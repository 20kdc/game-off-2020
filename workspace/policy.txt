FROM YOU TO YOURSELF : WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT CHANGE THE GAMEPLAY!
Changing the sprites is fine.
Simply put, altering the gameplay code in certain ways will break all the levels.
This is why the game still has an unrealistic 0.1 linear drag factor -
 the levels are now dependent on it.
Also the game's better with it because it stops dots just sticking around forever until they hit something.
