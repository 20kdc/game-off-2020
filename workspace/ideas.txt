MOONSHOT
 1. Literal (shoot the moon, i.e. with a gun)
  1b. Shooting the moon out of something
 2. Space/gravity/moon
 3. Impossible chances
  Probability?
 4. Destruction of the moon

of these, 3 looks the most interesting to me

CONCEPT: Circles -> tunable angles -> targets???

 WHY NOT BOTH????
 Circles with gravity that have to get through
  some sort of obstacle course.

Each individual dot can't have gravity, makes it too
 unpredictable

TODAY: get this working
also actual game logic
also the Stuff And Things Editor

EVENTUALLY:

VERTICAL SLICE
in particular, CUSTOMIZED LEVEL BACKGROUNDS would be nice

"chalkboard" aesthetic????
